* sqlite
** list tables
sqlite3 db\development.sqlite3;
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ORDER BY name;
SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table' AND tbl_name = 'table_name';
* postgres
to start the database server: 
 postgres -D (path to dat directory)
initially, connect as user 'postgres' and create a new role, a new database, and set privleges:
 psql -U postgres
 create user jack password 'password' (NOTE: user name will be lower-cased)
 create database (database name);
 grant all privileges on (database name) to (user name);
to connect to the database server: psql -d (database name) -U (user name)

* git
git push -u origin master
* scaffolding
rails generate scaffold user first_name:string last_name:string email:string login:string hashed_password:string salt:string
rails generate controller account login logout
rails generate scaffold building name:string address:text
rails generate scaffold spot building_id:integer number:integer floor:integer owner_id:integer
* Misc
strategy:
first, generate scaffolding for the major domain entities
then, generate database migrations to establish foreign-key relationships between them

need to set up "new spot" form to allow selection from pick list of buildings

ok, I've got postgres running
user name jack
password foo

 now, I have to make sure that I have the postgres adapter for ruby, and possibly the ActiveRecord adapter for postgres
